# Visualization of Performance Trajectories Using Sankey Charts
To effectively communicate student progress, we visualize performance trajectories with Sankey charts. These charts provide clear insights for teachers, student advisors, and program coordinators.
In a Sankey chart, each student state during a semester is represented by a vertical rectangle (called a node). The height of each node reflects the number of students in that state. Nodes are connected across semesters by flow lines, which indicate the transition of students from one state to the next. The width of each flow line corresponds to the number of students moving between these states, offering an intuitive visual of student transitions over time.

**1. Electrical Engineering (EE) category**: Figure [![Alt text](Results and Discussion/Electrical-Engineering-Category.png)](Results and Discussion/Electrical-Engineering-Category.png) shows a right-skewed performance trajectory for Electrical Engineering category which depicts that most of the students complete these courses in the earlier semesters of their degree. In the beginning, S1 contained varied performance states of small sizes representing ‘Excellent’ (E), ‘Good’ (G), ‘Average’ (A), and ‘Very Poor’ (VP.a, VP.b, and VP.c) performance states. In S2, two larger states of G-SD (good steady) and VP-D (very poor) are observed with students transitioning from almost all the states in S1. The data shows that students either performed well or struggled in their courses. These patterns could be linked to factors such as the difficulty of the courses, changes in faculty, and the grading scheme. Program coordinators can analyze these patterns and intervene as needed. In semester 3, we can see various levels of performance, with some students achieving good grades (G-SD.a, G-SD.b, G-I) and others experiencing a significant decline in their performance (VP-D). These patterns continue throughout the remaining semesters, with students moving back and forth within these states, making it challenging to identify and interpret any significant learning pattern.

**2. Electrical Engineering Lab (EL) category**: The EL performance trajectories shown in Figure ![Alt text](Results and Discussion/Electrical-Lab-Category.png) majorly contain states represented with different variants of ‘Good’ performance (i.e., state labels including G, G-I, and G-SD). Another prominent state label that appeared throughout this category is PD (poor decline performance). Students persistently transitioned between the ‘Good’ and ‘Poor’ performance states, probably due to varying course difficulty levels or grading schemes. Thus, teachers and program coordinators can gain useful insights from these learning patterns that help them in decision-making, e.g., the selection of a unified grading scheme in different course offerings and evaluating the impact of different faculty members teaching similar kinds of courses. As before, the right-skewed Sankey chart shows that students majorly completed these courses in earlier semesters.

**3. Management (MG) category**: Figure ![Alt text](Results and Discussion/Management-Category.png) contains performance trajectories of Management course category, which has shown to be quite easy for students belonging to different performance groups in Maqsood et al. (2023). A small number of states reflected in S1 and S2 represent records of transfer students who might have studied some MG courses earlier. At large students complete these courses in Semester-3 to Semester-5, with varied states representing good and average performances. No critical learning pattern is observed in this course category and thus student advisors can confidently utilize these courses while selecting easy courses in a next semester course plan for struggling students. A program coordinator can utilize this information to modify the curriculum and balance course difficulty levels offered in a semester.

**4. Social Science (SS) category**: Social Science (SS) category:. SS is previously identified as one of the easiest course categories for all kinds of students in Maqsood et al. (2023), but a visual analysis of the performance trajectories in Figure ![Alt text](Results and Discussion/Social-Sciences-Category.png) showed a persistent migration of the students between diverse performance states throughout.
Similar to the EE course category, performance trajectories of the Social Science category begin with students’ distribution across multiple performance states including ‘Excellent’ (E), ‘Good’ (G), ‘Average’ (A), and ‘Very Poor’ (VP.a and VP.b). In the second semester (S2), a large number of students showed good performance behaviors which we refer to as: (i) highperformance retainers – students from E and G states transitioning into GSD (good steady) state, and (ii) good-performance achievers – students from diverse performance states in S1 transitioned to G-I (good incline) state. Conversely, a reasonable number of students in the P-D (poor-decline) state remain there from the second semester (S2) to onwards, indicating persistent challenges some students face in improving their academic performance. The diagram shows a recurring pattern of students oscillating between ‘Good’ and ‘Poor’ categories, reflecting the fluctuating nature of student performance. Teachers and student advisors can utilize this information and extend their support to help students improve and sustain their academic achievements. Finally, many students tend to complete the Social Science category courses early in their degree program.

**5. Social Science Lab (SL) category**: This category has only 3 courses , which happen to be the easiest for students where excellent and good performance states are seen in large in Figure 15 (i.e., E (excellent) and G (good) states in Semester-1, and two variants of good state in Semester-2). All the students completed SL courses in two semesters with reasonably good grades. The SL chart is available in Figure ![Alt text](Results and Discussion/Social-Lab-Category.png).
